	<h1> Robotics Kick-off </h1>
	
	<p> Robotics kick-off is the day the new FRC game is released. This day is one of my favorite days because it is very important to the development of the new robot. 
		if we didnt know what game we were playing our robot, to be honest would suck. The day starts with the entire robotics team gathered in the LGI. Usually the smitkas supply 
		lunch last year it was tacos. Then at a certian time a live from nasa starts and the entire team is on edge ready for the new game. Our minds are in a million diffrent places 
		Think about all of the diffrent things it could be, the anticipation is high. After many commercials and other crap first puts in there live streams, the new game is released.
		along with the password for the PDF manuals. Listening to the video and reading through manuals for the next couple of hours trying to find loop holes through rules and other things
		breaking the game done its essential parts. Always the first thing that we taking about the diffrent types of robots other poeple will design what position are the best
		is it with it to make a robot that can do everything on the feild. </p>
